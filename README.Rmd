# Calculate Levenshtein distance between strings

## Introduction

`violinPointR` provides a few functions for simple Levenshtein alignment and distance calculation with multiple threads, ends-free and reduced homopolymer gap costs.

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("sherrillmix/levenR")
```

## Examples

### Basic Levenshtein distance

A simple example of calculating the Levenshtein distance between several strings to make a distance matrix:
```{r base-examples, tidy=FALSE}
library(levenR)
seqs<-c('AAATA','AATA','AAAT','ACCTA')
leven(seqs)
```
